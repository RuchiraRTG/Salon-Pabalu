IT Project 2024 Y2S2

Salon Pabalu is a university project built with the MERN stack, showcasing an elegant and user-friendly website. The home page allows users to explore a variety of salon services, view Courses, and book appointments seamlessly. Designed to enhance customer experience, the site represents the vision of a modern, professional salon.

In my section of the Salon Pabalu project, I focused on the Course Management feature. From the admin side, administrators can easily add, edit, and delete courses related to salon training. Customers can leave feedback about courses they've completed, helping to improve the quality of the training offered. Once a customer finishes a course, the platform automatically generates a certificate to acknowledge their achievement. This feature streamlines course management for the salon while enhancing the customer experience by providing valuable feedback and certificates, ensuring that clients receive recognition for their learning and dedication.
